LifestyleLinking
==========

The LifestyleLinking open source project sets out to explore how all life is connected.  The framework creates a site for individuals to connect to content that has been personalized based on their lifestyle.  As each individual structures the content in their own part of the information universe, the application allows for the sharing of this data between individuals to enhance the collective intelligence of all.  The core technology combines the mathematics of three ideas, wisdom of the crowd, relativity and gaia theory (data normalization).  Framework written in PHP.

Please note:  The project is currently going through a rebuild and the existing protoype code can be downloaded from <https://www.socialtext.net/lifestylelinking/>
