<h1> Version 0.1.1 beta</h1>
<h2> 19th June 2010</h2>
<p style="text-align: left"> a lifestylelinking platform</p>


<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>How is all life connected?  I started thinking about his during my years at University and subsequently applied some of those ideas to startups and those experiences started to formulate the idea of lifestylelinking.  In summary, Einstein gave the law of physics, E=mc2, relativity and I was inspired to think that all life is connected and in a relative manner.  Gaia theory, James Lovelock also showed how the normalization of different life ecosystems allowed them to be connected and finally 'wisdom of crowds', from the earliest amateur mathematician calculations to the PageRank concept deployed by the Google founders harness the collective intelligence.  The lifestylelinking platform pulls together these ideas into one, built on the principals that the individual owns their own data and they have the right to have it work for them, wherever. With the open sourcing of the code, I looking forward to contributing to the wider open source community and to sharing in the discoveries we may find along the way.  James</p>
