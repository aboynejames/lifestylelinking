I given my right shoulder a couple of week break from any streneous activity, well not humphing a pair of skis across a mountain side. And it feel real progress being made in my recovery. Still stiff on performing some gentle streaching exercise but reducing everyday, hopefully make it back to the swimming pool next week.
